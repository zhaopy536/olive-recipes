# ResNet optimization

This folder contains examples of ResNet optimization using different workflows.

- QDQ for Qualcomm NPU / AMD NPU
- OpenVINO for Intel® CPU/GPU/NPU
- Float downcasting for NVIDIA TRT for RTX GPU / DML for general GPU

## QDQ for Qualcomm NPU / AMD NPU

This workflow performs ResNet optimization with QDQ in one workflow. It performs the optimization pipeline:

- *PyTorch Model -> Onnx Model -> Quantized Onnx Model*

## OpenVINO Quantization Workflows with OpenVINO NNCF

This workflow performs quantization with OpenVINO NNCF. It performs the optimization pipeline:

- *HuggingFace Model -> OpenVINO Model -> Quantized OpenVINO Model -> Quantized encapsulated ONNX OpenVINO IR Model*

## Evaluation result

The quantization uses 256 samples from train split of imagenet-1k dataset and the evaluations uses 256 samples from test split of imagenet-1k dataset.
